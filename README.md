In PHP you can display emoji characters just by typing them:

```php
echo "ðŸ˜ƒ";
```

This package provides some functionality to work with emoji's if your IDE or used font can't render them correctly:

```php
Emoji::grinningFace();
```

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment you are required to send us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

The best postcards will get published on the open source page on our website.

## Install

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
composer require spatie/emoji
```

## Usage

The `Spatie\Emoji\Emoji`-class contains character constants that may be used directly:

```php
Emoji::CHARACTER_GRINNING_FACE;
```

Or your can use the shorter method by leaving off "character" and using camelCase:
```php
Emoji::grinningFace();
```

Want to repeat the emojis? Fine!
```php
Emoji::grinningFace(3);
```

You can also use an [ISO 3166 Alpha2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code and get the appropriate flag for the country:
```php
Emoji::countryFlag('be'); // ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª
```
